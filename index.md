### Research
The Yang Lab is interested in developing statistical and computational methods/tools for quantitative genomics data analysis and biomedical data analysis, using programming languages R, Python, C++, Perl, etc., Linux/Unix high-performance computing cluster, and Amazon Web Services.

<ins>Current Research Topics</ins>

* Transcriptome-wide Association Studies (TWAS) 
	* Method/tool development
	* Applications for studying Alzheimer's dementia related phenotypes, Breast Cancer, and Ovarian Cancer
* Machine learning and Deep learning
	* Biomedical signal/image analysis
	* Phenotype risk prediction using polygenic risk score and other risk factors
* Integrative multi-omics analysis including mediation analysis
* Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) 
	* Method/tool development to account for functional annotations
	* Applications for studying Alzheimer's dementia related phenotypes, and post chemotherapy skin toxicity of Breast cancer patients
* Bioinformatics analysis
	* ChIPseq and RNAseq analysis
	* Single cell RNAseq analysis

Dr. Yang accepts PhD students from graduate programs of [Genetics Molecular Biology](http://biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/GMB/) and [Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution](http://biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/PBEE/) under the [Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/), and Master/PhD students from the graduate program of the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics School of Public Health](https://sph.emory.edu/admissions/phd/index.html).

### PI - Background
* PhD in Statistics, 2009-2014, Department of Statistics, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA
* Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, 2014-2017, Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Biostatistics School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

My PhD work was about developing scalable nonparametric Bayesian model for functional data analysis. Since my postdoc training, I have been working on developing statistical tools and efficient computational algorithms for genetic association studies, integrative multi-omics data analysis, with the goal of illustrating underlying genomic etiology of complex diseases.
