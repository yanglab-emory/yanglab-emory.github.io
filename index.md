### Research
The Yang Lab is interested in developing statistical and computational methods/tools for quantitative genomics data analysis and biomedical data analysis. Programming languages we use include R, Python, C++, etc. Computation environment we use are Linux/Unix high-performance computing cluster and Amazon Web Services.

<ins>Current Research Topics</ins>

* Transcriptome-wide Association Studies (TWAS) method/tool development and applications for studying Alzheimer's dementia related phenotypes, Breast Cancer, and Ovarian Cancer
* Machine learning and Deep learning
	* Biomedical signal/image analysis
	* Phenotype risk prediction using polygenic risk score and other risk factors
* Integrative multi-omics analysis including mediation analysis
* Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) method/tool development
	* Applications for studying post chemotherapy skin toxicity of Breast cancer patients
* Bioinformatics analysis
	* ChIPseq and RNAseq analysis
	* Single cell RNAseq analysis

Dr. Yang accepts PhD students from the GMB/PBEE graduate programs of the [Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/programs/index.html) and the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics School of Public Health](https://sph.emory.edu/admissions/phd/index.html).

### PI - Background
* PhD in Statistics, 2009-2014, Department of Statistics, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA
* Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, 2014-2017, Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Biostatistics School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

My PhD work was about developing scalable nonparametric Bayesian model for functional data analysis. Since my postdoc training, I have been working on developing statistical tools and efficient computational algorithms for genetic association studies, integrative multi-omics data analysis, with the goal of illustrating underlying genomic etiology of complex diseases.
