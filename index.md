### Research
The Yang Lab are interested in developing methods and tools to integrate multi-omics (genetic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolomic) data for studying complex human diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease. We use Bayesian statistical methods and machine learning methods with efficient computational algorithms. We are also interested in applied next-generation sequencing analysis with Whole Genomce Sequencing, RNA Sequencing, and ChIP Sequencing data. Programing languages we use include R, Python, C++, Perl, etc.


### PI - Background

I obtained my PhD in Statistics (2014) in the Statistics Department at Rice University, Houston, TX. My PhD work was about developing nonparametric Bayesian model for functional data analysis. After my graduation, I started working on Statistical Genetics as a Postdoctoral Fellow (2014-2017) in the group of
Goncalo Abecasis in the Biostatistics Department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Since my postdoc training, I have been very interested in utilizing statistical tools and computational efficient algorithms for genomics data analysis.
