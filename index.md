### Postdoctoral Fellow Position Opening
Our lab currently has an openning for a self motivated postdoc. The candidate will be expected to work on statistical/computational method & tool development, sequence data analysis, and publishing on decent journals. The candidate will have opportunities to collaborate with members of the Center for Computational and Quantitative Genetics, as well as people from diverse departments (e.g., Human Genetics, Neurology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Psychology) at Emory University.

The candidate is expected to have a Ph.D. degree in Statistics/Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Computer Science or other relevant disciplines with interests in statistical genetics and strong quantitative research background; proficiency in one or multiple of the popular programming languages, e.g., C++, Python, R; experience working with large genetics data and high-performance computing clusters are desirable.

Interested candidate should submit a Cover Letter, CV, Brief Statement of Research & Interest (less than 2 pages), one Sample Publication and Contacts for 3 references. Please email application to Dr. Jingjing Yang <jingjing.yang@emory.edu>, or apply through <https://faculty-emory.icims.com/jobs/37626/job>. Applications will be reviewed immediately after submission. 


### Research
The Yang Lab are interested in developing satistical methods and tools to integrate multi-omics (genetic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolomic) data for studying complex human diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. We use Bayesian statistical methods and machine learning methods with efficient computational algorithms. We are also interested in sequence analysis with Whole Genome Sequencing, RNA Sequencing, and ChIP Sequencing data. Programming languages we use include R, Python, C++, etc. Computation environment we use are Linux/Unix high-performance computing cluster and Amazon Web Services. 


### PI - Background

I obtained my PhD in Statistics (2014) from the Statistics Department at Rice University, Houston, TX. My PhD work was about developing scalable nonparametric Bayesian model for functional data analysis. After my graduation, I started working on Statistical Genetics as a Postdoctoral Fellow (2014-2017) with
Goncalo Abecasis in the Biostatistics Department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Since my postdoc training, I have been working on developing statistical tools and efficient computational algorithms for genomics data analysis, with the goal of illustrating underlying genomic etiology of complex diseases.
