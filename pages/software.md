* SR-TWAS can leverage base imputation models for molecular traits that are trained with multiple statistical methods, multiple tissues, or multiple cohorts, to learn an optimal imputation model for the follow-up xWAS analysis.

* OTTERS is a powerful xWAS tool leveraging summary-level reference molecular QTL data to conduct gene-based association study with GWAS summary data.

role="button">BFGWAS_QUANT</a>

* BFGWAS_QUANT conducts Bayesian functional GWAS using multivariate quantitative functional annotations, which can be applied with both individual-level and summary-level GWAS data.

role="button">BGW-TWAS</a>

* Bayesian Genome-wide TWAS (BGW-TWAS) method is developed for leveraging both cis- and trans- eQTL through summary statistics for TWAS which is based on the BFGWAS framework.

role="button">TIGAR</a>

* Transcriptome-Integrated Genetic Association Resource (TIGAR) is developed for integrating gene-expression imputation model training, prediction, and TWAS in the same tool. Efficient handling of VCF genotype files and parallele computing have been implemented in TIGAR. **TIGAR can efficiently train both Elastic-Net and nonparametric Bayesian DPR models for gene expression imputation.**

* BFGWAS is developed for integrating functional annotation in GWAS by a scalable Bayesian method based on the Bayesian variable selection regression (BVSR) model and Expectation Maximization Monte Carlo Markov Chain (EM-MCMC) algorithm. **BFGWAS can now take summary GWAS data.**
